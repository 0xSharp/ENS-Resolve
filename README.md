# ENS-Resolve

A simple script for resolving a list of Ethereum Mainnet Addresses (if they have one).

Uses Ethers and an Alchemy API key.

Beware of rate limiting on Alchemy's side, the script pulls one ENS per second to make a best attempt at avoiding any limiting.

Simply Insert your list of addresses in the addressList array and replace the env variable for alchemyKey with your own API key and you're off to the races.

Please reach out on Twitter (@0xSharp) if you ever need assistance.
